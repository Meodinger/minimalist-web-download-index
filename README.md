# minimalist-web-download-index

In the case of some free cloud storage softwares have upload and download
limitation. I am very angry and write this index page to direct access my
files in my server.

## Installation

No need for more operations than any other normal .php page.

## Upload

Upload files simply in dir `files` or even in this dir via SSH or some
other methods you like.

## Download

Click dir to enter a dir in server.
Click file to download the file.

## Hint

You cannot use dir whose name contains '..' because I redirect any link
contains '..' to avoid illegal access to server file system.
